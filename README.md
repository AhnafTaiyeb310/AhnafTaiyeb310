## 🚀 About Me

I’m a junior full-stack developer passionate about building real-world web applications using modern frontend and backend technologies. I enjoy working on complete systems — from UI design to API development and database modeling.

I’ve built projects using **React, Next.js, Django, REST APIs, and SQL databases**, and I’m continuously improving my problem-solving skills through DSA practice and hands-on development.

Currently looking for **internship or junior full-stack developer roles** where I can learn, grow, and contribute to production systems.
